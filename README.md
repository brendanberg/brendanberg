I'm Brendan, a multidisciplinary software engineer with a background in computer science, human-computer interaction, and visual art.

Here are a few things I'm working on:

- [CM6][cm6], a visual programming platform consisting of an LED matrix display with a built-in ARM CPU
- [Pushpop][pushpop], a concatenative language for the CM6
- [ish][ish], a git-based issue tracker
